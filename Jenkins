Step 1: Check if Jenkins is accessible
    curl -v http://<target-ip>:8080/

Step 2: Check for Anonymous Access
    - curl -v http://<target-ip>:8080/manage
    - If you can access it without logging in, Jenkins might be misconfigured and exploitable.
    - If it asks for a login, we’ll try other methods.

Step 3: Try Default Credentials & Common Usernames
    admin:admin
    admin:password
    admin:jenkins
    admin:<blank password>
    admin:123456

    If these don’t work, check if the username field gives hints 
    (e.g., "Invalid username or password" vs. "Invalid password" — 
    this can reveal valid users).

Step 4: Check for Unauthenticated Access to Specific URLs
    1. Check for user list (may reveal usernames):
        curl -s http://<target-ip>:8080/asynchPeople/ | grep -i "href"
    2. Check for script console (rare, but worth trying):
        curl -s http://<target-ip>:8080/script
    3. Check for exposed configuration files:
        curl -s http://<target-ip>:8080/config.xml
        curl -s http://<target-ip>:8080/credentials/store/system/domain/_/
    4. Check if Jenkins version is exposed (for exploits):
        curl -s http://<target-ip>:8080/api/json

Step 5: If you can read files on a system , try to read 
            /etc/passwd - Know the home directory of jenekins user 
        And then read users registererd on the jenekins in -
            <JENKINS_HOME>/users/users.xml
            The JENKINS_HOME will be usually /var/jenkins_home/

Step 6: This file is also interesting if you have file read access
    /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

POST LOGIN
Step 1: Navigate to /script endpoint to check if you have console
Step 2: Go to /manage endpoint and check credentials . Sometimes private Keys
        are stored there . The key will be hidden . So go check in page source
