1. Look at the open ports and see if you can find anything interesting
	- netstat -antp
	a. If you find anything interesting , check what process is running
	   behind it
	   	- lsof -i :<PORT_NUMBER>
2. See what processes are running as root and try to exploit them
	- ps -ef
	- If you find anything interesting , do
		- lsof -p <PID>
3. Check for the files in the home directory . 
	- Do ls -alh and check for hidden files
4. Check sudo -l .

5. Check for suid bits 
	- find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
	- find / -perm -4000 -user root -writable 2>/dev/null
	- If you find any unknown or unsual files in here , take a loot at them for an exploit 

6. If there is any 7zip with root privileges ,  

7. Old passwords in /etc/security/opasswd

8. strings /dev/mem -n10 | grep -i PASS

9. If you found any application root folder , check HTDOCS directory for config files

10. Search for SSH files 
	- find / -name id_rsa -type f 2>/dev/null
	- You can do this command to check which is user is associated with this ssh key
		- cat id_rsa| grep -v "KEY" | base64 -d | xxd
	- After you do this , chmod 600 id_rsa and login with the user in above step

11. Check /etc/hosts for other subdomains
12. Check if you are inside a container
		- ls -la /
13. Check what network interfaces are listed 
		- ip a
14. Check what services are running on wireless interfaces
		- ss -lntp
15 . Run linpeas and in the section "Processed whose PPID belongs to a different user (not root)"
		- Check if your user has any listing
16. Check parent process capabilities section in linpeas
		- Check in ChatGPT for anything unusual

17. Check for capabilites in linpeas, if any library has setuid to get root
    access

18. If you can find any SUID root program to run or read files using LESS pager , you 
    can get a root shell when resizing the terminal
		- Refer https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qgrc-7333-5cgx
		- EXPLOIT
			- Set export PAGER=less
			- Then try to run the suid binary as root to read any file and resize the
			  terminal when less is not opened yet
			- Then open /bin/sh just like how you execute commands in vim to get root
			  shell

19. Check for environment variables or the hidden .env files using ls -al
20. Check for mails also . See mails section also in linpeas

FYI -- Do this for colored terminal in reverse shell
export LS_COLORS="di=34:ln=35:so=32:pi=33:ex=31";alias ls='ls --color=auto'
